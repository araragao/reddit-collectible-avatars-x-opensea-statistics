## FAQ

### What are Reddit Collectible Avatars?

Please refer to [Reddit's r/CollectibleAvatars FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollectibleAvatars/comments/x0tx59/hey_what_is_this_thing_collectible_avatar_faqs/) - I couldn't have written it better.

### Why does the project not follow X JavaScript/Node/Express/* development standard paradigm?

I'm not a JavaScript/Node/Express/* developer - my day-to-day activities are focused on Java and Spring.

If you have any suggestion drop me a message :)
